function [getperformance, deletetempfiles, forecastingperiod, weight_type1] = options_forecast

% OPTIONS_FORECAST  SubEpiPredict configuration for forecasting & ensembles
%
% Overview
%   Sets the forecast horizon, whether to compute performance metrics, whether
%   to delete temporary forecast MAT files, and the weighting scheme used to
%   build an ensemble from top-ranked models.
%
% Usage
%   [getperformance, deletetempfiles, forecastingperiod, weight_type1] = options_forecast;
%
% Returns
%   getperformance     (logical) 1=compute forecast performance metrics; 0=skip
%   deletetempfiles    (logical) 1=delete temporary 'Forecast-*.mat' files; 0=keep for audit
%   forecastingperiod  (int)     Number of steps ahead to predict (horizon)
%   weight_type1       (int)     Ensemble weighting:
%                                   -1: Equal weights over the top models
%                                    0: AICc-based weights (relative support)
%                                    1: Akaike weights (relative likelihoods)
%                                    2: WISC-based weights (Weighted Interval Score on calibration)
%
% Notes
%   â€¢ Ensure the weighting scheme aligns with the set of top models retained by the fit.
